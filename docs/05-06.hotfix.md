# Hotfix substance box 0.5 -> 0.6

## Setup

* Ensure you have substance 0.8+ installed
* Make sure your current syncher is running

## Copy the unison binaries from substance

Copy the unison ubuntu binaries to your devroot _(replace ENGINENAME with your engine name)_

```
cp -a /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/support/unison/ubuntu-14.04 ~/substance/ENGINENAME/unison-ubuntu-14.04
```

## Install the unison binaries into place

SSH into your engine and copy the unison binaries in their usage location

```
substance ssh
sudo cp /substance/devroot/unison-ubuntu-14.04/* /usr/local/bin
exit
```

## Shut down your engine

Kill the sync first then:

```
substance halt
```

## Modify your engine configuration to use the unison syncher 

_(replace ENGINENAME with your engine name)_


```
substance engine edit ENGINENAME

```


* Modify the `box` entry to refer to substance-box:0.6

`box: turbulent/substance-box:0.6`

* Remove `mode` and `excludes` blocks entirely and replace with:

```
  mode: unison
  syncArgs:
  - -ignore
  - Path */var
  - -ignore
  - Path */data
  excludes:
  - .swp
  - .npm*
  - .git
  - .viminfo
  - .bash*
  - .ssh
  - .composer
```

Save the configuration


## Edit your substance configuration default box

Edit `~/substance/.substance.yml` and ensure the `defaultBox` is set to 0.6 :

`defaultBox: turbulent/substance-box:0.6`

## Launch the engine

`substance launch`

## Launch the sync

`substance sync`
